# Crevshell tool from R-security:
Crevshell stands for "C reverse shell". This is a tool built in python that generates a reverse shell written in C language that could spawn a reverse shell back to the attacker from the target system, gaining overall access over the system.
This is basically built for Windows systems but can also be executed on linux targets as well.
# NOTE: 
        Be sure to edit the "ENTER_TARGET_PORT" & "ENTER_TARGET_IP" fields in the .py file.
